> ## Team Mnager `Full Stack`
#### Tech used: `MERN-Stack, Material-UI, reach/router`
Manage your team's roster and RSVP for a three-game series. In this project, I designed/built a mern app that enables users to add/remove players with their position. Every player has a current status of either 'Playing,' 'Not Playing,' 'Undecided,' that's different for every game.
